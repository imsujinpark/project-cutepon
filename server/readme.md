# API

## Error handling

Possible errors that the server might send.

```ts
enum Errors {
    AuthorizationMissing,
    AuthorizationExpired,
    AuthorizationInvalid,
    RegistrationInvalidEmail,
    SendCouponTargetUnknown,
    SendCouponTargetMissing,
    RedeemCouponIdMissing,
    RedeemCouponUnknownCoupon,
    RedeemCouponWrongOwner,
    RedeemCouponExpired,
    RedeemCouponNotActive,
    DeleteCouponIdMissing,
    DeleteCouponDeleteActiveNoAuthorized,
    DeleteCouponUnknownCoupon,
    RateLimitExceeded,
    NotImplemented,
    Internal
};
```

The errors sent will be of the following form:

```ts
{
    error: number,
    message: string
}
```

You can use the `error: number` to branch your logic depending on the error as it will map 1:1 to the `enum Errors` defined above.

Here is some global errors the server might send in any request:
* All the `Errors.Authorization*` errors (explained down below).
* In cases that an unexpected error happens in the server side (such as SQL connection issue, or google oauth service down) you will receive an `Errors.Internal`.
* Exceeding certain HTTP request threshold per minute will trigger a softban on the requestor's IP and return an `Errors.RateLimitExceeded`.
* In case of accessing a not yet implemented API, `Errors.NotImplemented` will be returned.

## Authorization

All routes starting with `/api/*` will have the `authorization` header check for a `token`.  
Those will reply with any of the following errors in case something is wrong with the authorization:

* `AuthorizationMissing`
* `AuthorizationInvalid`
* `AuthorizationExpired`


## About `Date`s

Every date will be sent in type `number`. The number represents the milliseconds passed since the `unix epoch` in `UTC`.
Those numbers are generated by the `getTime()` method in `Date` objects.

For now, the server will expect all the dates sent to be in the same format.

## `Coupon`s

The `CouponState` can be any of these:

```ts
export enum CouponStatus {
    Active,
    Redeemed,
    Deleted,
    Expired
}
```

## Routes

### GET `/api/hello`

**Response**: Plain text string `Hello ${user.public_id}!`

Example:

```
Hello amazing.email@gmail.com!
```

Use this API to test that `Authorization` is working as intended.

### POST `/api/redeem`

**Request**: Json string in the body.

```ts
{
    coupon_id: number, /** The id of the coupon to redeem */
}
```

**Response**: Json string in the body.
   
```ts
{
    id: number, /** Coupon identifier */
    title: string, /** The coupon title */
    description: string, /** The coupon description */
    created_date: number, /** The exact date the coupon was sent */
    expiration_date: number, /** The date the coupon expires */
    origin_user: string, /** The public_id of the user who sent the coupon */
    target_user: string, /** The public_id of the user who received the coupon */
    status: int,  /** The status of the coupon. Maps directly to the `enum CouponStatus` */
    finish_date: number | null /** The date a coupon was finished, (expired, used, or removed) */
}
```

**Possible errors**:

* `RedeemCouponIdMissing`: The coupon id is missing from the request.
* `RedeemCouponUnknownCoupon`: The coupon id is unknown.
* `RedeemCouponWrongOwner`: When the client who sent the request is not the owner of the coupon.
* `RedeemCouponExpired`: When the coupon has already expired.
* `RedeemCouponNotActive`: When the coupon is not active.

Redeems the `coupon` as long as it is possible to be redeemed by the user.
Returns the same `coupon` but with its data updated (status changed, finish_date changed...).


### POST `/api/delete`

**Request**: Json string in the body.

```ts
{
    coupon_id: number, /** The id of the coupon to delete */
}
```

**Response**: Json string in the body.
   
```ts
{
    id: number, /** Coupon identifier */
    title: string, /** The coupon title */
    description: string, /** The coupon description */
    created_date: number, /** The exact date the coupon was sent */
    expiration_date: number, /** The date the coupon expires */
    origin_user: string, /** The public_id of the user who sent the coupon */
    target_user: string, /** The public_id of the user who received the coupon */
    status: int,  /** The status of the coupon. Maps directly to the `enum CouponStatus` */
    finish_date: number | null /** The date a coupon was finished, (expired, used, or removed) */
}
```

**Possible errors**:

* `DeleteCouponIdMissing`: The coupon id is missing from the request.
* `DeleteCouponUnknownCoupon`: The coupon id is unknown.
* `DeleteCouponDeleteActiveNoAuthorized`: When the user is not allowed to delete an active coupon. Only the `target_user` of a coupon may delete an active coupon.

Deletes the `coupon`. This can mean 2 different things.
* Active `coupon`s can only be deleted by the target of the `coupon`. It will set the coupon as deleted and the coupon wont be redeemable anymore
* Deleting a non-active `coupon` will just hide, meaning that it wont be visible for that user anymore.

Returns the same `coupon` but with its data updated (status changed, finish_date changed...).

### POST `/api/send`

**Request**: Json string in the body.

```ts
{
    target_user: string, /** The public_id of the coupon's target user. */
    expiration_date: number?, /** The timetamp where the coupon expires. */
                              /** If null, default to 30 days. */
                              /** example: new Date("July 4 2034 12:30").getTime() */
    title: string?, /** The title of the coupon. If null, will default to "Coupon". */
    description: string?, /** The description of the coupon. If null, will default to an empty string "". */
}
```

**Response**: Json string in the body.
   
```ts
{
    id: number, /** Coupon identifier */
    title: string, /** The coupon title */
    description: string, /** The coupon description */
    created_date: number, /** The exact date the coupon was sent */
    expiration_date: number, /** The date the coupon expires */
    origin_user: string, /** The public_id of the user who sent the coupon */
    target_user: string, /** The public_id of the user who received the coupon */
    status: int,  /** The status of the coupon. Maps directly to the `enum CouponStatus` */
    finish_date: number | null /** The date a coupon was finished, (expired, used, or removed) */
}
```

**Possible errors**:

* `SendCouponTargetMissing`: When the target_user is missing.
* `SendCouponTargetUnknown`: When the target_user is not a known user in our database.

Creates a new `coupon` and sends it to the `target_user`.

### GET `/api/received`

**Response**: Json string in the body.
   
```ts
{
    /** A list of Coupons with status == Active */
    coupons: Coupon[] = [
        {
            id: number, /** Coupon identifier */
            title: string, /** The coupon title */
            description: string, /** The coupon description */
            created_date: number, /** The exact date the coupon was sent */
            expiration_date: number, /** The date the coupon expires */
            origin_user: string, /** The public_id of the user who sent the coupon */
            target_user: string, /** The public_id of the user who received the coupon */
            status: int,  /** The status of the coupon. Maps directly to the `enum CouponStatus` */
            finish_date: number | null /** The date a coupon was finished, (expired, used, or removed) */
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

Returns a list of all the received coupons that the sender has received (target_user === sender).
Authorization header is used to identify the user.

### GET `/api/sent`

**Response**: Json string in the body.
   
```ts
{
    /** A list of Coupons with status == Active */
    coupons: Coupon[] = [
        {
            id: number, /** Coupon identifier */
            title: string, /** The coupon title */
            description: string, /** The coupon description */
            created_date: number, /** The exact date the coupon was sent */
            expiration_date: number, /** The date the coupon expires */
            origin_user: string, /** The public_id of the user who sent the coupon */
            target_user: string, /** The public_id of the user who received the coupon */
            status: int,  /** The status of the coupon. Maps directly to the `enum CouponStatus` */
            finish_date: number | null /** The date a coupon was finished, (expired, used, or removed) */
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

Returns a list of all the coupons that the request sender has sent (origin_user === sender).
Authorization header is used to identify the user.

### GET `/refresh_token`

**Request**:

* Header `Authorization`. Set the `refresh_token` you got on login as the Authorization header.

**Response**: Json string in the body.
    
```ts
{
    token: string, /** Short duration token for accessing the APIs that require identification. */
                   /** Put this token as is in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests. */
    refresh_token: string, /** Long duration token used as a means of renewing your identification. */
                           /** If `token` expires, you can receive a new one by sending this `refresh_token` */
                           /** to the `refresh_token` API. */
}
```

Example:

```ts
{ token: "d4800779-b9b1-4e4d-bb00-d2579f3f9cdb", refresh_token: "fd38d2f6-6cad-4495-8280-a5b033e27abb" }
```

**Possible errors**:
* AuthorizationMissing
* AuthorizationInvalid
* AuthorizationExpired

The idea is that if you have no token (or it has been rejected on an API request), you use this API.  
If you have no `refresh_token`, you login again via `/oauth2/google`.

### GET `/oauth2/google`

**Response**: Redirection to google auth form

This is the API that acts both as a "login" and a "register".
Redirects the user to an authorization form `https:accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth`.
Completing the form will redirect the user, once again, to `/oauth2/google/callback`.
Finally, the client will be redirected to `/?token=#####&refresh_token=#####`. Check
`/oauth2/google/callback` for more information.

Because of how redirections work, the client is expected to "go" to
this location rather than make a GET request.

### GET `/oauth2/google/callback`

**Request**:

URL parameters:

* `code`: number. Code set automatically by google on auth form completion.

**Response**:
    
Redirection to `/oauth2/tokens` with 2 URL parameters:
* `token`: string. Short duration token for accessing the APIs that require identification.
Put this token as is in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests.
* `refresh_token`: string. Long duration token used as a means of renewing your identification.
If `token` expires, you can receive a new one by sending this `refresh_token` to the `refresh_token` API.

Example:

```
https://cutepon.net/oauth2/tokens?token=d4800779-b9b1-4e4d-bb00-d2579f3f9cdb&refresh_token=fd38d2f6-6cad-4495-8280-a5b033e27abb
```

The tokens returned will be subsequently used for accessing any API that requires authorization.
The client will never manually access this API.
When the client tries to login via oauth at `/oauth2/google` and completes the form,
google will redirect the client here, with the required data already set.
